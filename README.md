# budget-calculator
A simple exercise to add the total price of products together in a list

To be honest, my brain is fried from working so much so I'm not going to put a thourough explenation here. I started learning JavaScript and it's very confusing.

I was able to create this budget calculator that is simple enough. I do understand how it works line by line but it took a very long time to put it together.
